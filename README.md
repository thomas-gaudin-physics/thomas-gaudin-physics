- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thomas-gaudin-physics. I am a graduate student in Physics at New Mexico Tech.
-  Iâ€™m interested in binary stellar evolution and instrumentation development for optical interferometers.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Julia with an occasional piece of code added in C++. This is my repository to store all of the work I accomplish in graduate school.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that will help me grow as a programmer. Developing my coding skills is an important part of my career and I will happily join any project!
-  To collaborate or inquire about a piece of code, feel free to reach out via email at thomas.gaudin@student.nmt.edu.
